# Scrape & Classify
This is a side Python-based project that automatically collects Vietnamese news articles (over 60,000 from Vietnamnet), preprocesses the text, and uses a scikit-learn model to classify each article into one of several categories. Across the three core scripts (data gathering, preprocessing, and training), the system achieves over 91% accuracy in categorizing the news.
